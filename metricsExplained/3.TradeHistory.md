# Trade Metrics Explained

## SL%
- **Definition**: It calculates the percentage distance between the entry price and the stop loss.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  SL% = (Entry Price - SL) ÷ Entry Price
  ```

## Position Size
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Position Size = Quantity Traded x Entry Price
  ```

## Position Size %
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Position Size % = Position Size ÷ Account Value as on the trade open date
  ```

## RPT
- **Definition**: It stands for Risk Per Trade. It is the loss that would be incurred if the trade is exited at stop loss.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RPT = Quantity x (Entry Price - Stop Loss)
  ```

## RPT %
- **Definition**: RPT % calculates the percentage of account value at risk in case the trade fails.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RPT % = RPT ÷ Account Value as on the trade open date
  ```

## Exit %
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Exit % = Quantity Exited ÷ Total Quantity Traded
  ```

## Gain %
- **Definition**: It calculates the percentage distance between the entry price and the average exit price.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Gain % = (Exit Price - Entry Price) ÷ Entry Price
  ```

## Account Value
- **Definition**: Account Value refers to the value of your account as of the trade open date. It takes into account the net funds added up until the trade open date in addition to the realized profits up until the trade open date.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Account Value = Capital Deployed + Realised Profits till date
  ```

## Account Gain %
- **Definition**: AG % refers to the percentage increase in your account value resulting from that trade.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Account Gain % = Net Profit ÷ Account Value as on the trade open date
  ```

## Capital Deployed
- **Definition**: Capital Deployed refers to the capital brought in for trading. It is used to calculate Return On Capital Deployed (RoCD), which is the percentage return earned on the funds deployed for trading.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Capital Deployed = Total Funds added till trade open date
  ```

## RoCD
- **Definition**: It refers to the percentage gained from a trade over the capital deployed prevailing at the trade open date. It is a simple metric that shows the return on initial investment.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RoCD = Net Profit ÷ Capital Deployed as on the trade open date
  ```

## Starting Account Value
- **Definition**: Starting Account Value refers to the account value at the start of the calendar year (1st Jan). The role of this metric is to calculate yearly account growth, i.e., RoSV (Return on Starting Value).
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Starting Account Value = Net funds added till 31 Dec + Realised profits till 31 Dec
  ```

## Starting Account Value (Adj.)
- **Definition**: SAV does not consider deposits/withdrawals made in the current year. Hence, instead of SAV, we use the Starting Account Value (Adj.) to calculate RoSV.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Starting Account Value (Adj.) = Starting Account Value (1st Jan) + Net funds added in the current year till trade open date
  ```

## RoSV
- **Definition**: RoSV, which stands for Return on Starting Value, represents the percentage gain on your Starting Account Value (Adj.) for a given calendar year. To calculate the RoSV of each trade, the net profit of the trade is divided by the Starting Account Value (Adjusted) as of the trade's open date.  ROCD and ROSV are two different metrics used to calculate returns in trading. ROCD gives the percentage return over the initial capital invested, while ROSV calculates the percentage return over the starting account value for the year, including any deposits or withdrawals made in the current year till the trade was opened. ROSV is useful in measuring the annual return based on the starting account value for that year, while ROCD calculates returns over the net funds added till trade open date.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RoSV = Net Profit ÷ Starting Account Value (Adj.) as on the trade open date
  ```

## RR
- **Definition**: R multiple or Risk Reward ratio is used to calculate the profit with respect to risk taken.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RR = Gain % ÷ SL %
  ```
  or 
  ```
  RR = Net Profit ÷ RPT
  ```

## Charges
- **Definition**: It includes all trading charges like brokerage, duties, and taxes. It should not include personal income tax.
