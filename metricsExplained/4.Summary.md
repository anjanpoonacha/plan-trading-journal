# Summary Metrics Explained

The summary page shows aggregated metrics grouped by month, quarter, and year. This page helps you see how your system has performed over the selected period.

## Metrics Overview

### Open Trades
- **Definition**: The number of trades that are open at the start of the period.

### New Trades
- **Definition**: The number of new trades that are initiated during the period.

### Fully Closed
- **Definition**: The number of trades that were fully closed during the period.

### Partially Closed
- **Definition**: The number of trades that were partially closed during the period.

### Win Rate %
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Win Rate % = (Number of “fully closed” winning trades) ÷ (Total number of “fully closed” trades)
  ```

### Avg. RPT
- **Definition**: Average RPT for “fully closed” trades during the period.

### Avg. Loss
- **Definition**: Average Loss per each “fully closed” trade during the period.

### Avg. Gain
- **Definition**: Average Gain per each “fully closed” trade during the period.

### ARR
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Average Risk Reward Ratio = Avg. Gain ÷ Avg. Loss
  ```

### Profit
- **Definition**: Sum total of realised profits from “fully closed” and “partially closed” trades during the period.

### Charges
- **Definition**: Sum total of charges incurred for “fully closed” and “partially closed” trades during the period.

### Net Profit
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Net Profit = Profit - Charges
  ```

### Account Value
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Account Value = Net deposits till the last day of the period + Realised Gains till the last day of the period
  ```

### Capital Deployed
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Capital Deployed = Total Deposits - Total Withdrawals till the last day of the period
  ```

### RoCD
- **Definition**: Return on Capital Deployed (RoCD) represents the percentage gain on your capital deployed in a given period. It is calculated as the sum total of RoCD of each “fully closed” or “partially closed” trade during the period.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RoCD = Net Profit of the trade ÷ Capital Deployed (net funds added) as of the trade's open date
  ```

### Adjusted Account Value
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  Adjusted Account Value = Starting Account Value (1st Jan) + Net funds added in the current year till the end of the period
  ```

### RoSAV
- **Definition**: Return on Starting Account Value (RoSAV) represents the percentage gain on your Starting Account Value (Adj.) for a given period. It is calculated as the sum total of RoSAV of each “fully closed” or “partially closed” trade during the period.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  RoSAV = Net Profit ÷ Starting Account Value as on the trade open date
  ```

## Summary Verification Steps
1. Export all trades with relevant metrics.
2. In the exported Excel, select everything and add filters.
3. Fully Closed Trades + Partially Closed Trades = Trade Entry with date within period + Trade Exit with date within period. Add filter to the date column and select all the months that come within the respective period.
4. Fully Closed Trades = (Exit percent = 100) AND (Date of Trade Entry is within period OR Max(Trade Exit dates) is within period). Add date filter, add Exit Percent 100 filter, add max date filter.
5. Now add/count respective columns to derive various values and verify the calculations in the summary page.
