# Positions (Open Trades) Metrics Explained

The open trades page shows all the open positions, along with important information like the open %, open risk, exposure, etc. The open risk represents the amount of your current account value that is currently at stake. This is calculated for each trade as well as for all trades combined. Moreover, the page lets you modify stop losses of your open positions to see the effect on your open risk. In addition to open risk, the page also displays your total exposure in the market at present.

## Exposure
- **Definition**: It refers to the total value of the position at its cost price.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = Quantity × Entry Price
  ```

## Exposure %
- **Definition**: It refers to the percentage of current account value that is invested in a particular position.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = (Quantity × Entry Price) ÷ Account Value
  ```

## Total Exposure
- **Definition**: It refers to the total value of all open positions at their cost prices.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = Sum of exposure of all open trades.
  ```

## Total Exposure %
- **Definition**: It calculates the percentage of current account value that is exposed/invested in the market. It essentially shows your leverage.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = Sum of Exposure % of all open trades.
  ```

## Open Risk
- **Definition**: It refers to the amount of loss that would be incurred if the trade fails.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = (Current Stoploss - Entry Price) × Quantity
  ```

## Open Risk %
- **Definition**: It refers to the percentage decrease in your current account value if all the trades fail.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = Open Risk ÷ Account Value
  ```

## Total Open Risk
- **Definition**: TOR refers to the amount of loss that would be incurred if all the open trades fail.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = Sum of open risk of all open trades
  ```

## Total Open Risk %
- **Definition**: TOR % refers to the percentage decrease in your current account value if all the open trades fail.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  = Sum of open risk % of all open trades
  ```

## Current SL
By default, the current stop loss = original stop loss. Use the edit function to update the current stop loss for the trade to evaluate the updated open risk of that trade.

## CMP (Current Market Price)
Current Market Price will be updated automatically at the end of the day. Manually updating the price will override that. If the symbol is not in our database, you can manually update it. CMP will be used to evaluate the Unrealised Profit.

## SL%: Always uses original stop loss
## RPT: Based on initial risk calculation
## RR: Uses original stop loss
